* GENERIC FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT = 1N4148
* TYPE: DIODE
* SUBTYPE: SWITCHING
* THIS FILE CONTAINS 1 MODEL THAT CAN BE USED AS A TEMPERATURE TRACKING
* MODEL FROM -55 TO 125 DEG C.
* THIS MODEL CAN BE USED FOR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING DEVICES:
* 1N4148
* 1N4148-1
* 1N4148-1JTXV
* THE ROOM TEMPERATURE PRE-RAD PARAMETER SET SIMULATES NEARLY
* IDENTICALLY TO THE  -55 AND THE 125 DEG C WHEN .TEMP IS USED.  THIS
* PARAMETER SET CAN BE USED  AT ALL TEMPERATURES BETWEEN -55 AND 125 DEG
* C.
* PARAMETER MODELS EXTRACTED FROM MEASURED DATA.
*
* MEASURED TRR = 4.681NS, SIMULATED TRR = 6.544NS.
*
*** CAUTION: THE MEASURED TRR AND THE PSPICE CIRCUIT SIMULATED TRR ARE
* DIFFERENT.  THIS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ERRORS IN CKT. SIMULATIONS IF
* USED AS A RECTIFIER OR SWITCHING DIODE
*
* BV, IBV, XTI, EG HAVE NOT BEEN EXTRACTED AND ARE SET TO DEFAULT VALUES.
*
* RAD: PRERAD
* TEMP= 27
